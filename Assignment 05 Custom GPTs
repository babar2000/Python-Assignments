Q:

What are Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs), explain in detail?

Answer:

Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are systems designed to interact with users through natural language dialogue. Unlike traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that rely on visual elements like buttons and menus, CUIs allow users to communicate with the system using text or voice, just human-like conversation. Examples include chatbots, virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, and customer service bots.
