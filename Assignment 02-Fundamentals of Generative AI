Q:

Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.

Answer:

Artificial Intelligence:
The field focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
Example: Robotics


Machine Learning:
A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data provided.
Example: Spam detection, image recognition


Deep Learning:
A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep networks) to analyze various forms of data.
Example: Speech recognition, self-driving cars and language translation.


Generative AI:
A branch of AI focused on creating new content (text, images, music) that is similar to what it was trained on.
Examples: ChatGPT


Applied AI:
The practical application of AI techniques to solve real-world problems and enhance existing processes.
Example: AI in healthcare (diagnosis, treatment recommendations), finance (fraud detection, trading algorithms), and customer service (chatbots).

Q:

Define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and outline the five steps to achieve super-intelligence.

Answer:

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):

AGI refers to a type of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human-level, exhibit general mental abilities comparable to human intelligence.

Five Steps to Achieve Super-Intelligence:

Development of AGI:
    Create an AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do, exhibiting general mental abilities, knowing, learning and understand things.

Self-Improvement:
    Enable AGI to improve its own algorithms and architecture, leading to rapid advancements in its capabilities.

Enhancing Computational Resources:
    Invest in advanced hardware and infrastructure to support the increasing computational demands of AGI and its self-improvement processes.

Collaborative Intelligence:
    Foster collaboration between AGI systems to share knowledge and strategies, accelerating the collective learning process.

Ethical and Safety Measures:
    Implement robust ethical guidelines and safety measures to ensure that the development of super-intelligence is controlled, beneficial, and aligned with human values.
